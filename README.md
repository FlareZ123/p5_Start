# p5_Start
A little batch file to create an empty p5 project. 

## How to use it
You can just copy the "fresh_project_template"... but thas not why I made the "p5Start.bat" xD.

### How it was meant to be used
Save the "p5_Start" folder to a permanent directory.
Then add the directory to the windows path.
Finally , on lanch a console on the directory you want to create the project in, and call:  ``p5Start <name>`` , where <name> is the name of the project.
